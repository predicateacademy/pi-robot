Raspberry Pi Robots
====================
This is a 10-week course that we teach at [Predicate Academy](http://predicate.us) in NJ. Each weekly class runs for 60 minutes. We teach this program to kids 9-14 (and above). 

## Equipment
We buy most of our equipment from [Adafruit](http://adafruit.com). 

* [Raspberry Pi 2 Model 2 (or 3) B](https://www.adafruit.com/products/3055)
* [8GB SD Card](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2692) -- make sure you get a Class 10 for speed. 
* [Mini Robot Kit](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2939)
* [4 AA Battery Holder](https://www.adafruit.com/products/830).
* [RasPiRobot v3 Board](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1940)
* [Small Breadboard](https://www.adafruit.com/products/64)
* [Tact Buttons](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1119) - we like the ones with color tops.
* [HC-SR04 Rangefinder](http://www.amazon.com/SainSmart-HC-SR04-Ranging-Detector-Distance/dp/B004U8TOE6)
* 8 jumpers - [5x M/F](https://www.adafruit.com/products/826), [4x F/F](https://www.adafruit.com/products/266)

## Pi Setup
You'll need to have Rasbian Jessie installed and running on your Pi. There are a number of really good tutorials that walk through out to do this. You'll also need internet access on your Pi for initial install of the RasPiRobot python packages.
